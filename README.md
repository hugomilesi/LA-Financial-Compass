The frontend of the LA Music Financial Compass application is built with React (TypeScript) and appears to follow a modular, component-based architecture, leveraging custom hooks for data management and a UI component library for a consistent user experience.

Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionalities, data flow, and architecture:

1. Core Architecture & Data Flow
React & TypeScript: The application is built using React, indicating a component-driven UI. TypeScript is used for strong typing, enhancing code quality and maintainability, especially evident in the types/ directory.

Global State Management (Context API):

AuthContext.tsx: Manages the user's authentication state (logged in/out, user information).

PeriodContext.tsx: Likely controls the currently selected financial period (e.g., month, quarter, year), allowing data across different dashboards and reports to be filtered accordingly.

UnitContext.tsx: Manages the selected business unit, enabling users to view data specific to a particular unit.
These contexts provide a centralized way to share critical application-wide state across various components without prop-drilling.

Data Fetching & Logic (Custom Hooks): The hooks/ directory contains custom React hooks (e.g., useChartOfAccounts, useKPIGoals, useReports). These hooks encapsulate data fetching logic, state management, and side effects related to specific features. They interact with services/ to retrieve data from the backend.

Backend Communication (Services & Supabase Integration):

services/: Contains modules like aiInsightService.ts and dashboardService.ts, which abstract the API calls.

integrations/supabase/: This directory is crucial, indicating that the application directly interacts with a Supabase backend. It likely contains the Supabase client setup and specific functions for querying and mutating data in the Supabase database.

UI Component Library: The components/ui/ directory, with files like button.tsx, dialog.tsx, card.tsx, etc., suggests the use of a pre-built UI component library (likely Shadcn UI or similar). This ensures a consistent design system, accessibility, and faster development.

Utility Functions: The lib/utils.ts and utils/ directories provide general-purpose helper functions for tasks like data formatting, calculations, and potentially file downloads (fileDownload.ts).

2. Key Functionalities & Modules
